# YOLOv8 Wrapper Class and Fine-Tuning

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the implementation of a **wrapper class** for YOLOv8 and its **fine-tuning** for custom object detection tasks. The project utilizes Ultralytics' YOLOv8 model, providing streamlined methods for training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Introduction

YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8) is one of the most advanced real-time object detection models. This project extends its capabilities by implementing a flexible wrapper class for seamless fine-tuning and deployment. The goal is to simplify working with YOLOv8 in custom environments.

---

## Features

- Preprocessing datasets for YOLOv8 compatibility.
- Wrapper class for easier interaction with YOLOv8 models.
- Fine-tuning on custom datasets.
- Real-time inference with annotated outputs.
- Custom evaluation metrics for performance analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yolov8-wrapper-finetuning.git
   cd yolov8-wrapper-finetuning

2. Install the required dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Ensure YOLOv8 is installed:

bash
pip install ultralytics

4. Usage
Run the notebook: Launch the Jupyter notebook and open fork-of-yolov8-wrapper-class-fine-tuning.ipynb to explore the implementation.

Train the model: Modify the dataset path and training configurations in the notebook, then execute the cells for training.

Inference: Use the wrapper class methods to run inference on test data and visualize the results.

5. Dataset Preparation
Organize your dataset into the following structure
├── dataset
    ├── images
        ├── train
        ├── val
    ├── labels
        ├── train
        ├── val

6. Model Training and Fine-Tuning
Modify hyperparameters in the notebook for training.
Leverage transfer learning by starting with pretrained YOLOv8 weights.
Monitor training metrics and adjust learning rates, epochs, or augmentations as needed.

7. Inference
Use the trained model to perform inference on test images or videos. Annotated outputs will be saved in the specified directory.

8. Results
Include details on the performance of the fine-tuned model:

Metrics: mAP, Precision, Recall, etc.
Visual examples of detections on test data.
